== Notes ==
 * A family has to start somewhere.  Siblings are defined by having the same parent (at least one),
   so, at the top of the family tree, which are the root node grandparents, those grandparents
   can't have any siblings
 * Marriage is between two people, no checking is performed.  Polygamy is not allowed.
 * Divorce is not implemented, but would be supported.  People can end their marriage, marry to another, 
   and produce offspring
